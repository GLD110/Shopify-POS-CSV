BD-127WC,High Resolution Color CMOS Camera with Audio,Professional Cameras,,"Board Cameras are basically a fixed lens mounted onto a circuit board. These convenient covert cameras are often used inside ""mini cameras"" dome cameras and also for making hidden cameras and they are usually sold unpackaged to be mounted by the buyer.

Lenses inside these tiny cameras are either; a full opened lens or a pinhole lens in which the opening of the lens is very small. Pinhole lens cameras are often called ""spy"" cameras and are most often used in making hidden cameras. All of our hidden cameras are examples of hidden board cameras. For example in the Spy Pen there is tiny hole and it looks like a ""pin hole"" and that is where the lens is.

Lenses in board cameras are pre-mounted and have a fixed iris. In most cases they have a short focal length (the distance between the surface of the lens and it's focal point) which results in a wide angle of view. Our board cameras have a lens between 3.6 and 3.7mm.

Because board cameras have some many fixed features they are limited to what they can be used for. However they offer a low cost solution to security needs especially hidden camera situations.

Very small (3/4'' x 3/4'') audio/video camera. High resolution CMOS camera. Finally CMOS technology that virtually matches CCD quality at half the size. Plastic ABS enclosure.
